Excellent work! Your setup looks very clean and well-organized. Here's my review:

## âœ… What's Working Great:

1. **Version Management**: Perfect implementation with `Directory.Build.props` centralizing all .NET version settings
2. **Dockerfile**: Properly parameterized with `DOTNET_VERSION` ARGs
3. **Multiple GitHub Actions Workflows**: Good separation of concerns with different workflows for different purposes
4. **Project Structure**: Clean separation between Core library and Console app

## ðŸ”§ Issues to Fix:

### 1. **GitHub Actions YAML Formatting**
Your workflow files seem to have formatting issues. The content appears jumbled together. Here's how `release.yml` should look:

```yaml
name: Continuous Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0  # Need full history for version calculation
    
    - name: Generate version info
      id: version
      run: |
        # Generate version based on date and commit count
        VERSION="$(date +'%Y.%m.%d').$(git rev-list --count HEAD)"
        SHORT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
        FULL_VERSION="${VERSION}-${SHORT_SHA}"
        
        echo "version=${VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo "full_version=${FULL_VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo "sha=${SHORT_SHA}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        
        echo "Generated version: ${FULL_VERSION}"
    
    # Rest of the workflow...
```

### 2. **Push Your Changes**
You have 3 unpublished commits:
```powershell
git push origin master
```

### 3. **Consolidate Workflows**
You have 4 workflow files. Consider consolidating to 2-3 max:
- `build.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `release.yml` - Release creation
- Remove redundant ones like `build-docker.yml` and `multi-version-build.yml`

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Next Steps:

### 1. **Fix and Push**:
```powershell
# Push your changes
git push origin master

# Check GitHub Actions
Start-Process "https://github.com/kusl/tsp/actions"
```

### 2. **Test Docker Build Locally**:
```powershell
# Test with .NET 9
docker build -t tsp:net9 .

# Test with future .NET 10 (when available)
docker build --build-arg DOTNET_VERSION=10.0-preview -t tsp:net10 .

# Run quick test
echo "2`n5`n5`n" | docker run --rm -i tsp:net9
```

### 3. **Update README.md**:
Add badges and documentation:
```markdown
# TSP Solver

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Download Pre-built Binaries
Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/kusl/tsp/releases/latest)

### Run with Docker
```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/kusl/tsp:latest
```

### Build from Source
```bash
dotnet build TSP.sln
dotnet run --project TravelingSalesman.ConsoleApp
```

## ðŸ”„ Version Upgrade
When upgrading to a new .NET version, only update 3 lines in `Directory.Build.props`:
- `<TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>`
- `<DotNetVersion>10.0</DotNetVersion>`
- `<DotNetChannel>10.0</DotNetChannel>`
```

### 4. **Consider Simplifying Release Strategy**:
Instead of a release per commit, consider:
- **Rolling release**: Single "latest" tag that updates
- **Nightly builds**: Once per day
- **Tagged releases**: Only on version tags

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary:

Your implementation successfully addresses both concerns:
1. âœ… **Binary releases**: AOT compilation creates standalone executables
2. âœ… **Version management**: Centralized in `Directory.Build.props` and Dockerfile ARGs

The architecture is clean, maintainable, and ready for future .NET versions. Just fix the YAML formatting, push your changes, and you'll have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with binary releases!
